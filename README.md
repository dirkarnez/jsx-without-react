From [How to Use JSX Without React. JSX gives us a great way to handleâ€¦ | by Kartik Nair | Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-jsx-without-react-21d23346e5dc)

### Notes
- newer version of [@babel/standalone - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/standalone) does not work (expecting `window.React`). This project uses the oldest version `7.0.0`
